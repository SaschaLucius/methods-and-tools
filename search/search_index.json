Published in 1986, the article discusses a fresh approach to product development that emerged in response to the changing demands of the business environment.</p>","tags":["HTML5","JavaScript","CSS"]},{"location":"Agile/History/new_new/#summary","title":"Summary:","text":"<p>Takeuchi and Nonaka argue that traditional product development methods are insufficient for coping with the rapidly evolving markets and technologies. They propose a new approach called \"holistic\" or \"rugby\" product development, contrasting it with the more sequential and rigid \"relay race\" approach.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Relay Race vs. Rugby: The authors first compare the conventional \"relay race\" product development model to a \"rugby\" approach. In the relay race model, development proceeds in a linear, sequential manner, with each department passing the project on to the next. This leads to slow response times and lack of adaptability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cross-Functional Teams: In contrast, the rugby model involves cross-functional teams working together from start to finish. These teams are empowered to make decisions and are collectively responsible for the project's success.</p> </li> <li> <p>Iterative and Incremental Development: The authors advocate for an iterative and incremental development process in the rugby model. Instead of aiming for a perfect product from the outset, the team creates a prototype quickly and improves upon it in successive iterations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Feedback and Market Testing: Customer feedback and market testing are crucial in the rugby approach. By continually engaging with customers and incorporating their feedback, the team ensures the product meets market demands.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-Organizing Teams: The rugby model encourages self-organizing teams that have a high degree of autonomy and empowerment. These teams are better equipped to adapt to changes and capitalize on emerging opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Leadership and Vision: Effective leadership is essential in guiding the rugby product development process. Leaders must provide a clear vision, foster a collaborative culture, and support teams in their endeavors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Knowledge Creation: The authors emphasize the importance of knowledge creation throughout the development process. Knowledge is not just transferred but actively created and shared among team members, leading to organizational learning and improved future performance.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The article concludes that the rugby model of product development allows organizations to be more responsive, innovative, and successful in a rapidly changing business landscape. It encourages a customer-centric approach, adaptive teamwork, and continuous learning, making it a valuable concept for companies seeking to excel in product development and stay ahead of the competition.</p>","tags":["HTML5","JavaScript","CSS"]},{"location":"Agile/History/skunk/","title":"Skunk Works","text":"<ul> <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_Works</li> <li>https://notsvensson.medium.com/skunk-works-agile-before-its-time-ef4daf719376</li> </ul> <p>Skunk Works is a term that originated from a highly secretive and innovative advanced development group within Lockheed Martin, an American aerospace and defense company. The term has since become synonymous with any highly autonomous and innovative project team or division that operates with a high degree of independence from the parent organization.</p> <p>Skunk Works was originally founded in 1943 during World War II under the leadership of Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson. The group's objective was to rapidly develop and produce advanced aircraft for the United States military. The team's work was so secretive that it was said to be operating in a building that stunk like a \"skunk,\" hence the name \"Skunk Works.\"</p> <p>One of the most famous products to emerge from Skunk Works was the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a high-speed reconnaissance aircraft that was one of the fastest planes ever built. Skunk Works also played a significant role in the development of other iconic aircraft, including the U-2 spy plane and the F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter.</p> <p>The success of Skunk Works was attributed to several key factors:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Autonomy: The team was granted significant autonomy, allowing them to make rapid decisions without bureaucratic delays.</p> </li> <li> <p>Small, Cross-Functional Teams: Skunk Works employed small, hand-picked teams of experts from various disciplines, which facilitated efficient communication and problem-solving.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rapid Prototyping: The team emphasized quick prototyping and iterative development, enabling them to learn from mistakes and continuously improve the design.</p> </li> <li> <p>Secrecy: Skunk Works projects were conducted in strict secrecy, allowing the team to focus on their work without external interference.</p> </li> <li> <p>Customer Focus: The team was highly attuned to the needs of their clients, primarily the U.S. military, and focused on delivering innovative solutions to meet those needs.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Due to its success and reputation for innovative problem-solving, the term \"Skunk Works\" has been adopted more broadly to describe similar independent, highly innovative, and agile teams or projects in various industries, not just in aerospace and defense. These teams often tackle complex challenges and aim to disrupt established norms with their creative and unconventional approaches to problem-solving.</p>"},{"location":"Agile/History/tps/","title":"Toyota Production System (TPS)","text":"<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System</p>"},{"location":"Management/leadership_principles/","title":"Leadership Principles","text":"<p>https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles</p>"},{"location":"Management/leadership_principles/#customer-obsession","title":"Customer Obsession","text":"<p>Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.
